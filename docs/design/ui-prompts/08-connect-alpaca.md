## Screen Purpose

**User Goal**: Securely connect Alpaca brokerage account to enable portfolio execution.

**Key User Actions**:
1. Understand why connection is needed
2. Review permissions being requested
3. Choose paper trading or live trading
4. Click "Connect Alpaca Account"
5. Authorize on Alpaca OAuth page (external)
6. Return to app with connected account

## Design Rationale

**Why this design works**:
- **Benefits upfront**: User understands value before committing
- **Transparent permissions**: Explicitly list what we access (builds trust)
- **Security messaging**: OAuth 2.0, credentials never stored, revoke anytime
- **Paper trading default**: Reduces fear for first-time users
- **One action**: Clear single CTA (connect)
- **Honest disclaimers**: Not investment advice, orders at user's risk

## OAuth Flow Diagram

```
[App: Connect Alpaca Screen]
     ‚Üì User clicks "Connect"
[App: Loading state "Redirecting..."]
     ‚Üì Redirect to Alpaca
[Alpaca: Login page] (external)
     ‚Üì User logs in
[Alpaca: Authorization page] (external)
     "Invest with Billionaires requests access to..."
     ‚Üì User clicks "Authorize"
[App: OAuth callback URL]
     ‚Üì Exchange code for tokens
[App: Success modal "‚úì Connected"]
     ‚Üì Store tokens (encrypted)
[App: Redirect to Dashboard]
```

## Security Best Practices

**OAuth Implementation**:
- Use Authorization Code flow (not Implicit)
- State parameter for CSRF protection
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) if supported
- Store tokens encrypted at rest
- Refresh tokens automatically
- Handle token expiration gracefully

**User Education**:
- Explain OAuth: "You authorize on Alpaca's site, not ours"
- Clarify: "We never see your Alpaca password"
- Revocation: "You can revoke access anytime in Alpaca settings"

## Paper Trading vs. Live Trading

**Paper Trading** (Default for new users):
- Toggle ON by default
- Explanation: "Practice with simulated $100,000"
- No real money risk
- Connect to Alpaca Paper Trading API

**Live Trading**:
- Toggle OFF to use live trading
- Warning: "Real money will be used"
- Confirmation modal: "Are you sure? Real money will be invested."
- Connect to Alpaca Live Trading API

**Switch Later**:
- User can switch mode in Settings
- Requires reconnecting (different OAuth scope)

## Error Handling

**OAuth Errors**:
- **Canceled**: "You canceled the connection. No changes made."
- **Denied**: "Authorization denied. You can try again anytime."
- **Invalid State**: "Security error. Please try connecting again."
- **Network Error**: "Unable to reach Alpaca. Check your connection."
- **Token Exchange Failed**: "Connection failed. Please contact support."

**Display Strategy**:
- Show error in amber info box (not harsh red)
- Provide retry button
- Link to help docs or support
- Log errors for debugging (server-side)
