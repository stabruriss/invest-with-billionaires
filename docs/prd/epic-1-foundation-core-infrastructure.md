- [ ] User can browse 20+ institutional investor portfolios
- [ ] Authentication and user profiles functional
- [ ] Data pipeline ingests and refreshes portfolio data
- [ ] API endpoints perform under 500ms response time

## Dependencies for Future Epics

**Epic 1 provides foundation for**:
- **Epic 2**: Portfolio data and user authentication required for portfolio customization
- **Epic 3**: User profiles needed for Alpaca OAuth flow
- **Epic 4**: Portfolio data required for AI analysis context
- **Epic 5**: Historical portfolio data needed for performance tracking

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| financialdatasets.ai API quota exceeded | High | Implement aggressive caching, monitor usage daily |
| 13F data format changes | Medium | Build flexible parsing with validation, log anomalies |
| Authentication security breach | High | Use Firebase security rules, implement audit logging |
| Database schema changes needed later | Medium | Plan for migrations, avoid tight coupling |
| Deployment pipeline failures | Medium | Implement rollback procedures, staged deployments |

## Technical Debt Considerations

**Acceptable for MVP**:
- Simplified caching strategy (improve in Epic 2+)
- Manual curator selection of 20 investors (automate later)
- Basic error handling (enhance monitoring in Epic 5)

**Must Address in Epic 1**:
- Secure API key management
- Database indexing for performance
- Proper authentication token handling
