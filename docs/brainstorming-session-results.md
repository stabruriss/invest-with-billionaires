## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down portfolio creation system to fundamental building blocks

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Users explore famous 13F investors with historical performance data
2. Story-based investor metrics via AI research + formatted dashboards
3. Portfolio metrics calculated from market data (APY, MDD, vs SP500/TBIL)
4. Percentage-based allocation system (all holdings = 100%)
5. Fractional share execution through Alpaca API value-based orders
6. Portfolio editor for add/remove/adjust percentages with real-time metrics

**Insights Discovered:**
- Percentage allocation elegantly solves capital scaling (billionaire $10B → user $10K)
- 13F data needs transformation from holdings to actionable portfolios
- Two-layer metrics needed: investor story + current portfolio performance

**Notable Connections:**
- Fractional shares enable perfect portfolio replication regardless of capital
- AI research can bridge gap between raw 13F data and user understanding

### Morphological Analysis - 10 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down MVP into key feature dimensions and combinations

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Onboarding: Minimal Alpaca connection only
2. Data Pipeline: 3rd party API (financialdatasets.ai), ~100 portfolios initially
3. Core Features: Copy, edit, sync, execute, monitor
4. AI Components: Portfolio recommendation, analysis (portfolio + individual assets)
5. Real-time market data integration for AI context

**Insights Discovered:**
- External APIs reduce development complexity significantly
- AI can handle both discovery and analysis functions
- Starting with 100 portfolios provides good selection without overwhelming complexity

**Notable Connections:**
- AI recommendations + real-time data = dynamic vs static portfolio management
- Third-party data + Alpaca execution = clean separation of concerns

### Question Storming - 8 minutes

**Description:** Identifying critical decisions and potential challenges for MVP

**Ideas Generated:**
1. API rate limit management strategy
2. Data refresh frequencies for different components
3. Portfolio discovery and filtering mechanisms
4. Handling allocation rule violations during editing
5. Partial execution failure scenarios
6. AI hallucination prevention measures
7. Analysis trigger mechanisms (user request + weekly reports)

**Insights Discovered:**
- Resource constraints can be addressed through gradual scaling approach
- User experience challenges need elegant UI solutions
- AI integration requires careful disclaimer and validation approaches

**Notable Connections:**
- Firebase/Supabase free tiers enable MVP validation without upfront costs
- User-triggered AI analysis prevents unnecessary API consumption

### Resource Constraints - 7 minutes

**Description:** 3-month part-time development roadmap prioritization

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Reduced scope: Start with ~20 portfolios instead of 100
2. Development sequence: Data pipeline → Editor + Alpaca → AI analysis
3. Killer feature identification: Real-time AI portfolio comparison with market context
4. MVP validation approach with 10 early users

**Insights Discovered:**
- Real-time AI analysis differentiates from static 13F copying
- Market context transforms portfolio comparison into intelligent optimization
- Sequential development reduces complexity and risk

**Notable Connections:**
- AI + fresh market data = unique value proposition
- Smaller initial scope enables faster iteration and learning

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Percentage-based Portfolio System**
   - Description: All holdings sum to 100%, fractional shares enable any capital amount
   - Why immediate: Alpaca API already supports fractional shares and value-based orders
   - Resources needed: Basic math calculations, API integration

2. **Third-party 13F Data Integration**
   - Description: Use financialdatasets.ai for clean 13F data instead of building scraper
   - Why immediate: API available, reduces compliance and data cleaning complexity
   - Resources needed: API subscription, basic data processing

3. **Minimalist Alpaca Onboarding**
   - Description: Leverage existing Alpaca OAuth flow, no custom authentication
   - Why immediate: Alpaca handles all compliance, reduces regulatory risk
   - Resources needed: Standard OAuth integration, API key management

### Future Innovations
