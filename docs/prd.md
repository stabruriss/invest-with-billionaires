# Invest with Billionaires Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable retail investors to copy and customize institutional portfolios from famous hedge fund managers and billionaire investors in under 30 minutes
- Provide real-time AI market analysis that transforms 45-day-old 13F data into current investment intelligence 
- Deliver one-click portfolio execution through fractional share trading via Alpaca integration
- Achieve 40%+ monthly user retention with users successfully copying institutional strategies
- Generate $90K-$180K ARR in Year 1 with 500-1,000 paying subscribers at $15-25/month pricing

### Background Context

The platform addresses a critical gap in retail investing where semi-sophisticated investors (800K-1.2M addressable market) currently spend 3-5 hours manually researching 13F filings, calculating position sizes, and executing trades with zero insight into current market relevance. Existing solutions like WhaleWisdom provide static historical data without execution capability, while robo-advisors automate execution but ignore institutional wisdom.

"Invest with Billionaires" transforms this fragmented process into a streamlined workflow by combining percentage-based portfolio copying with real-time AI analysis, enabling users to answer "Is Buffett's Q2 position in Apple still smart given today's market conditions?" while executing complete portfolios in minutes rather than hours.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a "Spotify for institutional investing" experience where users discover institutional portfolios like music playlists, customize their version, and receive AI-powered market commentary. The interface should feel professional yet approachable, reducing the 3-5 hour research process to under 30 minutes through intuitive workflow design and clear information hierarchy.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Portfolio Browser**: Card-based grid layout showcasing famous investors with photos, performance metrics, and recent moves - enabling quick scanning and selection

**Percentage-Based Editor**: Interactive allocation interface with drag-and-drop sliders, real-time 100% validation, and visual feedback for modifications vs. original strategy

**One-Click Execution**: Streamlined confirmation flow with clear cost breakdown, fractional share explanation, and integration status with Alpaca brokerage account

**AI Analysis Trigger**: Prominent but contextual AI insights button that provides market commentary without overwhelming the core portfolio workflow

### Core Screens and Views

**Dashboard**: Portfolio performance overview with institutional vs. customized comparisons, recent AI insights, and quick access to modify allocations

**Investor Portfolio Browser**: Grid of 20+ curated famous investors with filtering by performance, sector focus, and recent activity

**Portfolio Detail & Editor**: Split-pane view showing original institutional allocations alongside user's customized version with percentage adjustment controls

**Execution Confirmation**: Order preview screen with position sizing, fractional share details, and cost breakdown before Alpaca integration

**Performance Tracking**: Real-time comparison charts showing user portfolio vs. original institutional strategy with key metrics highlighting

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure screen reader compatibility for financial data tables, keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, high contrast mode for market data visualization, and alt-text for investor photos and chart graphics.

### Branding

Modern, trustworthy financial interface with premium feel to justify $15-25/month pricing. Clean typography emphasizing data clarity, subtle animations for state transitions, and professional color palette building confidence in AI-powered investment decisions. Avoid gamification that might undermine serious financial decision-making.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Optimized for desktop research workflow during market hours, with mobile-responsive design for portfolio monitoring and quick modifications. Touch-friendly controls for percentage adjustments on tablets, with progressive enhancement ensuring full functionality across all devices.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing separate packages for frontend, backend, and shared types/utilities. This approach supports the 3-month MVP timeline with easier dependency management and unified development workflow while maintaining clear service boundaries for future scaling.

### Service Architecture

**API-First Monolith within Monorepo**: Initial monolithic backend service with clear separation between data pipeline, portfolio engine, and AI analysis services. This balances rapid MVP development with future microservices migration path. Core services include:

- **Data Pipeline Service**: 13F data ingestion and processing via financialdatasets.ai
- **Portfolio Engine**: Percentage-based allocation calculations and validation  
- **Trading Integration**: Alpaca API wrapper with OAuth and order management
- **AI Analysis Service**: OpenAI/Claude API integration with prompt optimization
- **User Management**: Authentication and portfolio history tracking

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for portfolio calculation logic and API integrations, plus integration tests for critical user workflows (portfolio copying, trade execution). Given the financial nature, testing must validate calculation accuracy, API error handling, and user data integrity. Manual testing convenience methods required for Alpaca sandbox integration.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety across financial calculations, Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for rapid professional UI development

**Backend Technology**: Node.js/Express.js for API consistency with frontend, serverless functions for AI analysis triggers to manage costs

**Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL for portfolio data and user management with ACID compliance for financial transactions, Redis for caching API responses and real-time portfolio calculations

**Hosting Infrastructure**: Vercel/Netlify for frontend deployment, Railway/Render for backend hosting, leveraging free tiers during MVP validation with clear scaling path

**Security Requirements**: OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, encrypted API key storage, HTTPS everywhere, SEC compliance disclaimers integrated throughout UX flow

**API Integration Constraints**: Intelligent caching and batching strategies required for financialdatasets.ai and AI provider rate limits, cost-efficient market data refresh strategies targeting <$0.50/user monthly budget

**Development Workflow**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, automated testing pipeline, environment-specific deployments with production safeguards for financial data
